# NOTE REPO

Note Repo is an Open Source, collaborative effort to make sharing lecture materials easier. It spawned out of the need to have a central place where study, lecture materials or note links can be sent so it's easier to access for anyone. Currently, the project is maintained by two Computer Science undergrads â€” so if you want to contribute to it, and have the technical skills, feel free to do so!
